            As of my last update in September 2023, AngularJS was a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. However, it's essential to note that AngularJS has reached its end of life, and developers are encouraged to use the latest version, Angular (also known as Angular 2+), which offers more features, better performance, and ongoing support.

            For building an online property house details application using Angular, you would typically follow these steps:
        </h4>
        
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading3">1. Setup:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.<br/>
            ✍️. Install Angular CLI globally using npm: npm install -g @angular/cli.<br/>
            ✍️. Create a new Angular project: ng new property-details-app.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading4">2. Create Components:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. In Angular, components represent the building blocks of your application's user interface. Create components for displaying property details, search functionality, etc.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">3. Service for Data Retrieval:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Create a service that interacts with an API or a backend to fetch property details.<br/>
            ✍️. Use Angular's HttpClient module to make HTTP requests to the server.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">4. Routing:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Set up routing to navigate between different sections of your application.<br/>
            ✍️. Angular provides the RouterModule for handling routing.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">5. Display Property Details:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Use Angular data binding to display property details retrieved from the server in your components.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">6. Implement Search Functionality:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Create a search component that allows users to search for specific properties.<br/>
            ✍️. Implement the search logic and connect it to your data service.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">7. Styling:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Use CSS or a preprocessor like SCSS to style your application and make it visually appealing.
        </p>
        <h4 id="scrollspyHeading5">8. Deployment:</h4>
        <p class="px-5">
            ✍️. Once your application is ready, build it for production using the Angular CLI: ng build --prod.<br/>
            ✍️. Deploy the built files to a web server or a hosting service.
